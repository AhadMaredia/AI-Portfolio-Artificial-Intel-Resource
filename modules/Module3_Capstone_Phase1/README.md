# Module 3: Machine Learning Basics
This module introduces ML concepts, common algorithms, and model training workflows.

## Topics Covered

- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Training, testing, and validating models
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Common algorithms (kNN, Decision Trees, Naïve Bayes)

## Assignments in This Module

- ML algorithm comparison chart
- Train a small ML model using guided steps
- Capstone: Define your model’s role in the final project

## Capstone Project Connection
For the capstone, you:

- Describe what ML model your assistant will use
- Explain how your model will be trained
