# Capstone Project — Phase 4

Integrated System Prototype*

This module required integrating the machine learning model with a functioning UI/system.

## Prototype Features

- Upload sales data (CSV)

- Automated preprocessing pipeline

- Model inference using the XGBoost .pkl file

- Output:

  Weekly demand predictions

  Suggested high-demand / trending products

- Optional dashboard or interface (depending on group implementation)

## Artifacts

- ZIP file containing:

  Front-end UI

  Back-end scripts

  Model loading pipeline

  Any Flask/Streamlit/FastAPI implementation

## Skills Gained

End-to-end machine learning integration

Linking ML models with user interfaces

API handling & data flow
